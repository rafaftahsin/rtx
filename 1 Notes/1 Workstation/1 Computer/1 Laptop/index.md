### My Choice of Laptop

- MacBook Air / Pro 
- Thinkpad


### ~~Why I prefer Thinkpad over MacBook~~

- Linux acts weirad with Mac Machines
- Macbook's Wifi devices acts weired with Linux OS

Edit: Januray, 2005

- I no longer prefer thinkpad over macbook.
- I've recently used latest macbook (macbook with m3 processor. I'm convinced with it's performance, OS stability, portability etc.)
- MacBook's battery is way better than Thinkpad.
