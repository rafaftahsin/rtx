### Trello vs Akiflow vs TimeStripe

- Price 
  - Per month ~ $6
  - Per month ~ I don't know ... how you negotiate 
- Feature
  - You can drag a task up and down in Trello
  - You can't in akiflow 
- Feature : Block a calender window for a task
  - very seamless in both trello & akiflow
- Feature : Can Add task from mail, IM, jira etc
  - Trello has inbox and you can add any task to it.
  - So do Akiflow 
- Task Grouping 
  - aki flow enforces you to create a project first and put every task under project. 
  - Trello's approach is better. You have task. you can group them by adding cover color to them.
