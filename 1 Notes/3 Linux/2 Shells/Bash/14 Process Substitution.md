title: Process Substitution
---

Process substitution allows a processâ€™s input or output to be referred to using a filename.

```shell
<(list)
```

Or 

```shell
>(list)
```

N:B: 

- Note that no space may appear between the < or > and the left parenthesis, otherwise the construct would be interpreted as a redirection.
